## My Research Work

This project is part of my ongoing research in optimizing Large Language Model inference for efficient deployment across diverse GPU architectures. The goal is to address the challenges of massive GPU memory requirements and significant computational demands associated with modern LLMs.

### Background

Large Language Models have revolutionized natural language processing, but their inference poses significant challenges due to high GPU memory and computational demands. Traditional methods often rely on static memory allocation, leading to memory fragmentation and underutilization of GPU resources.

### Contributions

FutureDynamic introduces several innovations:

- **Predictive Prefetching**: Uses historical data to predict future memory needs, reducing latency spikes.
- **Hybrid Offloading**: Dynamically offloads KV blocks to CPU or NVMe storage, minimizing memory footprint.
- **Multi-GPU Coordination**: Balances memory load across GPUs for near-linear scaling of throughput.
- **Energy-Aware Scheduling**: Adjusts memory management based on real-time power usage for improved efficiency.

### Experimental Evaluation

Experiments conducted on a multi-GPU system demonstrate substantial improvements in throughput, latency, and energy efficiency compared to traditional static allocation methods.
